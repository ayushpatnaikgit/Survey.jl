# [Generalized Linear Models in Survey](@id manual)

The `svyglm()` function in the Julia Survey package is used to fit generalized linear models (GLMs) to survey data. It incorporates survey design information, such as sampling weights, stratification, and clustering, to produce valid estimates and standard errors that account for the type of survey design.

As of June 2023, the [GLM.jl documentation](https://juliastats.org/GLM.jl/stable/) lists the supported distribution families and their link functions as:
```txt
Bernoulli (LogitLink)
Binomial (LogitLink)
Gamma (InverseLink)
InverseGaussian (InverseSquareLink)
NegativeBinomial (NegativeBinomialLink, often used with LogLink)
Normal (IdentityLink)
Poisson (LogLink)
```

Refer to the GLM.jl documentation for more information about the GLM package.

## Fitting a GLM to a Survey Design object

You can fit a GLM to a Survey Design object the same way you would fit it to a regular data frame. The only difference is that you need to specify the survey design object as the second argument to the svyglm() function.

```julia
using Survey
apisrs = load_data("apisrs") 

# Simple random sample survey
srs = SurveyDesign(apisrs, weights = :pw) 

# Survey stratified by stype
dstrat = SurveyDesign(apistrat, strata = :stype, weights = :pw) 

# Survey clustered by dnum
dclus1 = SurveyDesign(apiclus1, clusters = :dnum, weights = :pw) 
```

Once you have the survey design object, you can fit a GLM using the svyglm() function. Specify the formula for the model and the distribution family. 

The svyglm() function supports all distribution families supported by GLM.jl, i.e. Bernoulli, Binomial, Gamma, Geometric, InverseGaussian, NegativeBinomial, Normal, and Poisson. 

For example, to fit a GLM with a Binomial distribution and a Logit link function to the `srs` survey design object we created above:
```julia
using Survey
apisrs = load_data("apisrs") 

# Bootstrapped simple random sample survey design
srs = SurveyDesign(apisrs, weights = :pw) 
bsrs = bootweights(srs, replicates=500)

# Pre-processing
rename!(bsrs.data, Symbol("sch.wide") => :sch_wide)
bsrs.data.sch_wide = ifelse.(bsrs.data.sch_wide .== "Yes", 1, 0)

# Fitting GLM
model = svyglm(@formula(sch_wide ~ meals + ell), bsrs, family = Binomial(), LogitLink())

# View the coefficients and standard errors
model.Coefficients
model.SE
```

## Examples

The examples below use the `api` datasets, which contain survey data collected about California schools. The datasets are included in the Survey.jl package and can be loaded by calling `load_data("name_of_dataset")`.

### Bernoulli with Logit Link

Let us assume that the likelihood of receiving awards (`awards`) follows a Bernoulli distribution, which is characterized by modeling binary outcomes (0 or 1). Suppose we want to predict the likelihood of receiving awards based on the percentage of students eligible for subsidized meals (`meals`) and the percentage of English Language Learners (`ell`). We can fit this GLM using the code below:

```julia
using Survey
apisrs = load_data("apisrs")
srs = SurveyDesign(apisrs, weights = :pw) 

# Convert yes/no to 1/0
apisrs.awards = ifelse.(apisrs.awards .== "Yes", 1, 0)

# Fit the model
model = glm(@formula(awards ~ meals + ell), apisrs, Bernoulli(), LogitLink())
```

### Binomial with Logit Link

Let us assume that the number of students tested (`api_stu`) follows a Binomial distribution, which models the number of successes out of a fixed number of trials. Suppose we want to predict the number of students tested based on the percentage of students eligible for subsidized meals (`meals`) and the percentage of English Language Learners (`ell`). We can fit this GLM using the code below:

```julia
using Survey
apisrs = load_data("apisrs")
srs = SurveyDesign(apisrs, weights = :pw) 

# Rename api.stu to api_stu
rename!(apisrs, Symbol("api.stu") => :api_stu)

# Normalize api_stu
apisrs.api_stu = apisrs.api_stu ./ sum(apisrs.api_stu)

# Fit the model
model = glm(@formula(api_stu ~ meals + ell), apisrs, Binomial(), LogitLink())
```

### Gamma with Inverse Link

Let us assume that the average parental education level (`avg_ed`) follows a Gamma distribution, which is suitable for modeling continuous, positive-valued variables with a skewed distribution. Suppose we want to predict the average parental education level based on the percentage of students eligible for subsidized meals (`meals`) and the percentage of English Language Learners (`ell`). We can fit this GLM using the code below:

```julia
using Survey
apisrs = load_data("apisrs")
srs = SurveyDesign(apisrs, weights = :pw) 

# Rename api.stu to api_stu
rename!(apisrs, Symbol("avg.ed") => :avg_ed)

# Fit the model
model = glm(@formula(avg_ed  ~ meals + ell), apisrs, Gamma(), InverseLink())
```
